    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello my name is Zacky Viriot I plan on being a full stack developer when I am older
            I want to work for a fang company, I enjoy learning everyday and solving challenges hobbies include
            coding basketball and tennis hopefully you give me a chance and look at my profile.
        </p>
        <h2>Why I wanted to be a full stack developer</h2>
        <p>
            When I joined the computer science field I didn't really know what I wanted to do with it just yet 
            but I realized really quickly that I had a passion for web applications and how they worked. I really wanted 
            to learn how the front end and backend were able to connect together. I made it my mission to learn how to code 
            web applications and next thing you know here we are today.
        </p>
        <h2>Besides coding hobbies and interests</h2>
        <p>
            Besides coding there are many other things that I like to do with my free time. I really enjoy playing tennis and basketbal with 
            my friends I also enjoy listening to music as for me music is a big part of my life. I like going outside going on trips traveling the world.
            I feel like there are so many things out there in the world so many cultures and different percpectives in life and I want to see as many of them 
            as I can. 
        </p>
